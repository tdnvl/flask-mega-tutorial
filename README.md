# The Flask Mega-Tutorial

This repo covers Miguel Grinberg's _Flask Mega-Tutorial_. I am adding my personal notes as I'm going through itâ€”how I understand things.

## Microblog

Create directory, move to directory.

Start Pipenv shell:

`sudo pipenv shell`

Pipfile is then created.

Install Flask:

`sudo pipenv install flask`

Will install Flask and create the `Pipfile.lock`.

The application will exist in a package. In Python, a sub-directory that includes a __init__.py file is considered a package, and can be imported.

Create app folder:

`mkdir app`

Create __init__.py file:

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

from app import routes
```

Flask needs to be told how to import it, by setting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

`export FLASK_APP=microblog.py`

To start the app, execute `flask run`. Make sure the be in the virtual environment; start it with `pipenv shell`.

## Push to Heroku

Initiate Git in the app folder:

`git init`

Install gunicorn:

`sudo pipenv install gunicorn`

Create Procfile under the root:

`touch Procfile`

The file will just contain:

`web: gunicorn microblog:app`

Add all files, initial commit, and push on Heroku:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit."
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

Open the app:

`heroku open`

Celebrate: ðŸŽ‰

## Templates

Templates are stored under `app/templates/` as html files. Templates are returned by functions in `routes.py`.

Dynamic content in templates is enclosed in `{{ ... }}`.

The templates are rendered in `routes.py` by the `render_template()` function. This funtion accepts argumentsâ€”the dynamic content mentioned above. Don't forget to import the function!

`from flask import render_template`

The templates are rendered by Jinja2, the template engine for Python that comes with Flask.

### Conditional statements

Jinja2 supports conditional statements so we can do more interesting stuff such as:

```
{% if title %}
<title>{{ title }} - Microblog</title>
{% else %}
<titile>Welcome to Microblog</title>
{% endif %}
```


### Loops

Let's use some more dummy data to loop through posts:

```
posts = [
        {
            'author': {'username': 'John'},
            'body': 'Beautiful day in Portland!'
        },
        {
            'author': {'username': 'Susan'},
            'body': 'The Avengers movie was so cool!'
        }
    ]
```
